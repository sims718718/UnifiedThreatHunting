# üìÑ Low-Frequency External DNS Queries by TLD

## üîç Analysis

This query detects **low-volume outbound DNS queries** for specific query types (`A`, `TXT`, `AAAA`) and aggregates them by **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**. It is designed to help threat hunters identify:

- **Domain generation algorithm (DGA)** activity
- **Beaconing or staging** behavior via uncommon or obscure domains
- **Data exfiltration over DNS**, especially via `TXT` queries
- **Initial access or malware callouts** using newly registered or rarely seen domains

By focusing on low-frequency domains (less than 10 queries across the environment), this detection filters out noisy legitimate traffic and highlights outliers worth investigating.

## üìö Data Sources

- **Table:** `DeviceNetworkEvents`
- **Key Fields:**
  - `ActionType`
  - `AdditionalFields.query`
  - `AdditionalFields.qtype_name`
  - `AdditionalFields.rcode_name`
  - `RemoteIPType`
  - `DeviceName`
  - `Timestamp`
